# ITGR-CAT
ITGR - Central Administration Tool

Application for controling different services running on the ITGR networks... Parts requiring login to ITGR servers
will not be commited to GIT, though the rest will appear..

Nothing much have been done with the app yet so there isn't much interesting to see here...
